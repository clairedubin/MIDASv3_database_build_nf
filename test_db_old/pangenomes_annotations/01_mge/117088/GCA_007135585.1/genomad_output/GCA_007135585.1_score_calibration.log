[16:57:59] Creating the GCA_007135585.1_score_calibration directory.            
[16:57:59] The uncalibrated classification scores were loaded.                  
[16:57:59] Your sample has less than 1,000 sequences, which does not allow      
           precise composition estimation. The 'metagenome' preset will be used 
           instead. If you want to force the empirical sample composition       
           estimation anyway, use the --force-auto option.
